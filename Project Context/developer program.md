Your memberships essentially act as “keys” to the latest toolchains and firmware that the Slurm‑based plan depends on. Here’s how each status maps to the components in the MoSCoW list and the new orchestration setup:

- **NVIDIA Developer & AI Aerial programs / NGC Catalog** – These accounts give you access to pre‑release CUDA toolkits, drivers and SDKs. For the Slurm cluster you’ll want to request the CUDA 13.1 toolkit, JetPack 7 beta for the Jetson Orin and RAPIDS 26.02 preview; these programmes routinely distribute them to registered developers. They also provide early versions of NeMo, NIM microservices, Triton and CUDA‑X libraries, so you can build Apptainer/Singularity images with the newest GPU support

- **NVIDIA 6G Developer** – This grants early access to the Aerial SDK and Magnum IO improvements. You can download the latest Aerial 25‑2 release and future 6G‑ready drivers directly from the portal. Even though these components are “should‑have” in your MoSCoW list, having them early lets you experiment with high‑throughput I/O and 6G research on the Jetson once it’s integrated via Slurm.

- **Docker Beta Developer Program** – Since you’re dropping Docker Swarm but keeping Docker Engine, this status is useful for trying upcoming Docker features (for example, improvements in `docker buildx` or experimental GPU‑sharing flags) before they hit general release. You can then wrap those containers inside Slurm jobs.

- **GitHub Student Developer Pack** – Use this to host your Slurm job scripts and container recipes in private repositories without cost. It also includes free credits for Codespaces and GitHub Actions, which can build your Apptainer images remotely and push them back to your cluster.

- **Google AI Pro / Azure Education Hub / Azure AI Foundry** – These cloud programmes grant you preview access to tools like Azure’s MLflow integration or Google’s Vertex AI SDKs. While your platform is local, they’re handy for off‑line testing of TensorFlow or JAX builds compiled against CUDA 13. You can download those binaries and run them locally under Slurm.

- **Meta Developer Models** – Through the Meta developer program you can legally download Llama 4 (Scout, Maverick) and other Llama 3.x models. These weights can then be quantised with TensorRT and served on your desktop via Slurm‑managed jobs, giving you access to state‑of‑the‑art LLMs without waiting for public release.
  
  eferencing the redesigned idea of storing pre loaded containers locally on the nas to help guide the user through setting up the custom centralized secure system to preload containers reducing api exposure. reference the project files and tailor specifically to my system, this solution should only use tools from kubernetes,docker, Unifi, and other software mentioned in the MoSCoW prioritization. Slurm will be used for orchestration between nodes with docker only running the engine to deploy containers. no functionality should be lost while remaining easy to setup(JIT is not necessary), performance of the whole system is to remain the same to maximize utilization of all owned hardware. all performance metrics need to be met.Thought for 20sProduction-Ready
