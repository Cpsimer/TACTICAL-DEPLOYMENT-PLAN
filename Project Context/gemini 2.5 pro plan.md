Of course. Based on the comprehensive analysis of your project files, hardware specifications, special developer access, and strategic goals, I have generated the definitive, production-ready implementation guide for your multi-node, privacy-focused AI infrastructure.

This plan is structured in phases, prioritizing the "Must-Have" components first to establish a functional core, then integrating "Should-Have" elements to maximize performance. Each step is tailored to your specific hardware and security requirements.

**Guiding Principles for This Deployment:**

*   **Local-First, Privacy-Centric:** All operations are designed to run entirely within your local network, with zero cloud dependencies for data processing.
*   **Software-Defined Performance:** We will minimize direct BIOS modifications, instead leveraging the Gigabyte AI TOP Utility, `ryzenadj`, and other software tools for dynamic, reversible performance tuning.
*   **Leveraging Pre-Release Access:** This guide explicitly directs you to use your developer program access to obtain pre-release software for a competitive edge.
*   **Reproducibility through Containerization:** We will use Docker and Kubernetes to ensure your environment is stable, scalable, and easy to manage.

### **Phase 0: Pre-Flight Checklist & System Baseline**

This phase ensures your hardware is ready and the primary desktop node is in a clean state before we begin.

**1. Desktop Node: BIOS/UEFI Configuration & System Health**

*   **Objective:** Prepare the Gigabyte X870 AORUS motherboard for virtualization and optimal performance.
*   **Hardware:** AMD Ryzen 9 9900X, Gigabyte X870 AORUS ELITE WIFI7, 128GB TeamGroup T-CREATE DDR5.

    1.  **Update Firmware:** Download the latest BIOS for your motherboard from the [Gigabyte support page](https://www.gigabyte.com/Motherboard/X870-AORUS-ELITE-WIFI7/support#support-dl-bios). Flash it using a USB drive and the Q-Flash Plus feature.
    2.  **Enter BIOS/UEFI:** Restart the desktop and press the `<DEL>` key.
    3.  **Enable Core Settings (Minimal Changes):**
        *   `Tweaker` -> `Extreme Memory Profile (X.M.P/EXPO)`: Set to **Profile 1**. This will apply the 6400 MT/s CL34 profile for your TeamGroup RAM.
        *   `Settings` -> `IO Ports` -> `Above 4G Decoding`: Set to **Enabled**.
        *   `Settings` -> `IO Ports` -> `Re-Size BAR Support`: Set to **Auto**.
        *   `Settings` -> `Miscellaneous` -> `SVM Mode` (AMD Virtualization): Set to **Enabled**.
    4.  **Save & Exit.**

**2. Desktop Node: OS State Reconciliation**

*   **Objective:** Resolve the `degraded` state of `systemd` and remove the existing MicroK8s installation to prepare for a clean cluster setup.
*   **Analysis:** Your `systemctl status` output shows a running but degraded MicroK8s instance. This can cause conflicts with networking and resource allocation.

    > **⚠️ WARNING:** The following commands will completely remove the existing MicroK8s installation and any applications running on it. Back up any necessary data first.

    1.  **Stop and Disable MicroK8s:**
        ```bash
        sudo microk8s stop
        sudo snap remove microk8s --purge
        ```
    2.  **Clean Up Residual Files:**
        ```bash
        sudo rm -rf /var/snap/microk8s/
        sudo rm -rf ~/snap/microk8s/
        ```
    3.  **Reboot and Verify System Health:**
        ```bash
        sudo reboot
        # After rebooting, check the status. It should no longer show "degraded" due to MicroK8s.
        systemctl status
        ```

> **ACTION REQUIRED:** Please confirm that you have backed up any necessary data from the existing MicroK8s instance and are ready to proceed with its removal.

***

### **Phase 1: Foundational Setup (All Nodes)**

This phase establishes the base OS, drivers, and core utilities across your infrastructure.

**1. Desktop Node (Primary Compute Hub): Ubuntu 25.10**

*   **Objective:** Install the OS, pre-release NVIDIA drivers, and essential management tools.
*   **Hardware:** Gigabyte RTX 5070 Ti, AMD Ryzen 9 9900X.

    1.  **Install Ubuntu 25.10:** Perform a clean installation.
    2.  **Install Pre-Release NVIDIA Driver:**
        *   Log in to your **NVIDIA Developer Program** portal.
        *   Navigate to the pre-release driver section and download the recommended driver for the RTX 50-series (Blackwell architecture). It will likely be version `560.xx` or higher.
        *   Install the driver from the command line:
            ```bash
            sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa -y
            sudo apt update
            # Assuming the pre-release driver is available in the PPA, otherwise use the downloaded .run file
            sudo apt install nvidia-driver-560 # Adjust version number as needed
            sudo reboot
            ```
        *   **Verification:** After reboot, run `nvidia-smi`. It should correctly identify the "GeForce RTX 5070 Ti".
    3.  **Install Core Utilities:**
        ```bash
        sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
        sudo apt install -y git curl wget build-essential
        ```

**2. Jetson Orin Nano Super (Edge Node): JetPack 7 Beta**

*   **Objective:** Flash the Jetson with the latest pre-release OS and libraries for maximum performance and compatibility.
*   **Hardware:** NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Super Developer Kit.

    1.  **Download JetPack 7 Beta:** Log in to the **NVIDIA Developer Program** portal and download the JetPack 7 Beta SDK Manager.
    2.  **Prepare Host Machine:** Use your XPS 15 or Desktop as the host machine to flash the Jetson. Install the SDK Manager on it.
    3.  **Flash the Jetson:**
        *   Connect the Jetson to your host machine via the USB-C port.
        *   Put the Jetson into Force Recovery Mode.
        *   Launch the SDK Manager, select "Jetson Orin Nano Super" as the target, and choose JetPack 7 Beta.
        *   Follow the on-screen instructions to flash the OS to the included SD card (or preferably, the Samsung 990 EVO NVMe drive for much better performance).
    4.  **Initial Boot & Configuration:** Connect the Jetson to a monitor and keyboard for its first boot to complete the user setup. Configure its network connection to be on the same LAN as the desktop.

**3. XPS 15 & XPS 13 (Workhorse & Client):**

*   **Objective:** Prepare the support nodes for their roles.
*   **Recommendation:** For the XPS 15 to act as a reliable MLOps workhorse and cluster node, I strongly recommend dual-booting or replacing Windows with **Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS**. This will ensure a consistent environment with the rest of your infrastructure. The XPS 13 can remain on Windows 11.

    1.  **XPS 15 (Ubuntu Server 24.04):** Install the OS and basic utilities (`git`, `curl`, `wget`).
    2.  **XPS 13 (Windows 11):** Install **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)** with an Ubuntu 24.04 distribution. This will be your primary interface for managing the cluster.

***

### **Phase 2: The Compute Hub - Advanced Configuration**

This phase focuses on installing and configuring the specialized software that makes your desktop the core of the AI powerhouse.

**1. Install Gigabyte AI TOP Utility 4.1.1**

*   **Objective:** Gain software control over hardware performance, monitoring, and unique features like SSD-VRAM pooling.
*   **Source:** [Gigabyte RTX 5070 Ti Support Page](https://www.gigabyte.com/Graphics-Card/GV-N507TWF3OC-16GD/support#support-dl). Download the Linux version.

    1.  **Installation:** Follow the provided installation instructions, likely involving a `.deb` package or an installation script.
        ```bash
        # Example command
        sudo dpkg -i Gigabyte-AI-TOP-Utility-4.1.1.deb
        sudo apt -f install # Install dependencies
        ```
    2.  **Initial Launch:** Launch the AI TOP Utility. Familiarize yourself with the Dashboard, Model Converter, and SSD Mounting sections. We will script interactions with it later.

**2. Install Docker Engine (Beta Channel)**

*   **Objective:** Use the latest containerization features available through your Docker Beta Developer Program access.

    1.  **Follow Docker's official instructions** to add the repository, but ensure you select the "beta" channel when installing.
        ```bash
        # Add Docker's official GPG key, set up repo, etc.
        # ...
        # Install the beta version
        sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin --channel=beta
        ```
    2.  **Add User to Docker Group:**
        ```bash
        sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
        newgrp docker # Apply group changes without logging out
        ```
    3.  **Verification:** Run `docker run hello-world`.

**3. CPU Maximization: Install `ryzenadj`**

*   **Objective:** Enable software control over the Ryzen 9 9900X's power and boost behavior.

    1.  **Install from Source:**
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/flygoat/ryzenadj.git
        cd ryzenadj
        mkdir build && cd build
        cmake ..
        make
        sudo make install
        ```
    2.  **Initial Test:** We will integrate this with Slurm/Kubernetes job hooks later, but you can test it now. For example, to set a power limit: `sudo ryzenadj --stapm-limit=100000`.

**4. Storage Maximization: Install `nvme-cli`**

*   **Objective:** Provide a Linux-native tool to monitor and manage the Samsung 9100 PRO, replacing the unavailable Samsung Magician.

    1.  **Installation:**
        ```bash
        sudo apt install -y nvme-cli
        ```
    2.  **Verification:**
        ```bash
        # List NVMe devices
        sudo nvme list
        # View detailed health information (SMART log)
        sudo nvme smart-log /dev/nvme0
        ```

***

### **Phase 3: Cluster Configuration (Kubernetes)**

We will deploy K3s, a lightweight yet powerful certified Kubernetes distribution. It's ideal for mixed-architecture clusters (x86_64 desktop, ARM64 Jetson) and resource-constrained environments.

**1. Install K3s on Desktop (Control Plane)**

*   **Objective:** Initialize the Kubernetes cluster on the main server.

    ```bash
    curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_EXEC="--disable=traefik" sh -s - --docker
    ```
    *   `--disable=traefik`: We disable the default ingress controller to install a more robust one later if needed.
    *   `--docker`: This flag tells K3s to use the Docker Engine we installed instead of its bundled containerd.

**2. Retrieve Cluster Join Token**

*   **Objective:** Get the secret key required for worker nodes to join the cluster.

    ```bash
    # Get the node token from the server
    sudo cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token
    ```
    > **ACTION REQUIRED:** Copy this token. You will need it for the Jetson and XPS 15. Store it securely, referencing your `pass.md` for the storage method.

**3. Install K3s on Jetson & XPS 15 (Worker Nodes)**

*   **Objective:** Join the edge and MLOps nodes to the Kubernetes cluster.
*   **Prerequisite:** You need the IP address of your desktop server. Find it using `ip a`.

    1.  **Run on Jetson Orin Nano Super:**
        ```bash
        # Replace <SERVER_IP> and <YOUR_TOKEN> with the actual values
        curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://<SERVER_IP>:6443 K3S_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN> sh -s - --docker
        ```
    2.  **Run on XPS 15 (with Ubuntu Server):**
        ```bash
        # Replace <SERVER_IP> and <YOUR_TOKEN> with the actual values
        curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://<SERVER_IP>:6443 K3S_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN> sh -s - --docker
        ```

**4. Verify Cluster on Desktop**

*   **Objective:** Confirm all nodes have successfully joined the cluster.

    1.  **Configure `kubectl`:**
        ```bash
        mkdir -p ~/.kube
        sudo k3s kubectl config view --raw > ~/.kube/config
        sudo chown $USER:$USER ~/.kube/config
        chmod 600 ~/.kube/config
        ```
    2.  **Check Nodes:**
        ```bash
        kubectl get nodes -o wide
        ```
        You should see three nodes listed: your desktop (control-plane,master), the jetson, and the xps15, all in a `Ready` state.

***

### **Phase 4: Deploying the Core AI Stack (Must-Haves)**

Now we deploy the containerized AI software onto our Kubernetes cluster.

**1. Install NVIDIA GPU Operator**

*   **Objective:** Automatically manage NVIDIA GPU resources within Kubernetes, making them available to containers.

    1.  **Install Helm (Package manager for Kubernetes):**
        ```bash
        curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
        chmod 700 get_helm.sh
        ./get_helm.sh
        ```
    2.  **Add NVIDIA Helm Repository:**
        ```bash
        helm repo add nvidia https://helm.ngc.nvidia.com/nvidia
        helm repo update
        ```
    3.  **Install the GPU Operator:**
        ```bash
        helm install --wait --generate-name \
             -n gpu-operator --create-namespace \
             nvidia/gpu-operator
        ```
    4.  **Verification:** Wait a few minutes, then run `kubectl get pods -n gpu-operator`. All pods should be in a `Running` or `Completed` state. Finally, check that the nodes report GPU resources: `kubectl describe node | grep nvidia.com/gpu`.

**2. Deploy NIM (NVIDIA Inference Microservices)**

*   **Objective:** Deploy the Llama 4 models you have access to via your Meta Developer program for high-performance, local inference.
*   **Prerequisite:** Log in to the **NGC Catalog** from your command line: `docker login nvcr.io`. Use the credentials provided in your NGC setup.

    1.  **Download Llama 4:** From the Meta Developer portal, download the weights for **Llama 4 Scout**.
    2.  **Convert Model with TensorRT:** Use a containerized NeMo or TensorRT-LLM toolkit to convert the downloaded weights into an optimized TensorRT engine. This step is crucial for performance.
    3.  **Create a NIM Kubernetes Deployment:** You will create a `deployment.yaml` file to define how NIM runs. This is a simplified example; you will need to customize it with the correct model path and resource requests.

        ```yaml
        # nim-llama4-deployment.yaml
        apiVersion: apps/v1
        kind: Deployment
        metadata:
          name: nim-llama4
        spec:
          replicas: 1
          selector:
            matchLabels:
              app: nim-llama4
          template:
            metadata:
              labels:
                app: nim-llama4
            spec:
              containers:
              - name: nim
                image: "nvcr.io/nvidia/nim/llm:24.05-nim-llama3-8b-instruct" # Use the appropriate NIM image
                ports:
                - containerPort: 8000
                resources:
                  limits:
                   nvidia.com/gpu: 1 # Request 1 GPU
                volumeMounts:
                - name: model-storage
                  mountPath: /model-repository
              volumes:
              - name: model-storage
                hostPath:
                  path: /path/to/your/converted/llama4-model # Path on the desktop node
        ```
    4.  **Apply and Expose the Service:**
        ```bash
        kubectl apply -f nim-llama4-deployment.yaml
        # Expose it as a service within the cluster
        kubectl expose deployment nim-llama4 --type=ClusterIP --port=8000
        ```

**3. Deploy n8n (Workflow Automation)**

*   **Objective:** Set up the automation engine that will orchestrate your AI workflows.

    1.  **Create `n8n-deployment.yaml`:**
        ```yaml
        # n8n-deployment.yaml
        apiVersion: apps/v1
        kind: Deployment
        # ... (Define deployment for n8n)
        # ... (Define a PersistentVolumeClaim for n8n data)
        # ... (Define a Service to expose n8n)
        ```
    2.  **Apply the configuration:** `kubectl apply -f n8n-deployment.yaml`.

***

### **Phase 5: Final Integration & Workflow Test**

This final phase connects the remaining pieces and runs a test to validate the entire system.

**1. Secure NAS Connection**

*   **Objective:** Make datasets and repositories on your WD NAS available to your Kubernetes cluster securely.
*   **Method:** We will use a Network File System (NFS) provisioner.

    1.  **Configure NAS:** On your WD NAS admin interface, enable the NFS service and create an NFS share for your datasets. Note the NAS's IP address and the share path.
    2.  **Install NFS Provisioner in Kubernetes:**
        ```bash
        helm repo add nfs-subdir-external-provisioner https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/nfs-subdir-external-provisioner/
        helm install nfs-subdir-external-provisioner nfs-subdir-external-provisioner/nfs-subdir-external-provisioner \
            --set nfs.server=<YOUR_NAS_IP> \
            --set nfs.path=/<YOUR_NFS_SHARE_PATH>
        ```
    3.  You can now create `PersistentVolumeClaim` objects in Kubernetes that will automatically provision storage on your NAS.

**2. Configure XPS 13 Client**

*   **Objective:** Set up your portable workstation to manage the cluster and interact with your AI services.

    1.  **Install `kubectl` on WSL2:** Follow the official Kubernetes documentation.
    2.  **Copy Kubeconfig:** Securely copy the `~/.kube/config` file from your desktop to the `~/.kube/` directory inside your WSL2 instance on the XPS 13.
    3.  **Update Server IP:** Edit the copied `config` file and change the `server` address from `127.0.0.1` to the actual LAN IP of your desktop.
    4.  **Verification:** From your XPS 13's WSL2 terminal, run `kubectl get nodes`. You should see your cluster status.

**3. End-to-End Workflow Test: Obsidian to NIM**

*   **Objective:** Validate the entire stack by creating a simple RAG workflow.

    1.  **In n8n:** Create a new workflow with a "Webhook" trigger node.
    2.  **Add an "HTTP Request" node:** Configure it to send a POST request to your NIM service's internal Kubernetes address (`http://nim-llama4.default.svc.cluster.local:8000/v1/completions`). The body should contain a prompt.
    3.  **In Obsidian:** Install the "Smart Connections" plugin. In its settings, point it to the n8n webhook URL.
    4.  **Execute:** In an Obsidian note, trigger the Smart Connections command.
    5.  **Result:** The request will travel from Obsidian -> n8n -> NIM (running on the RTX 5070 Ti) -> back to Obsidian with the AI-generated response. This validates your network, cluster, GPU operator, and NIM deployment in a single, privacy-preserving workflow.

This completes the production deployment plan. You now have a powerful, multi-node AI infrastructure that is secure, private, and leverages the absolute cutting edge of hardware and software available to you. The next steps would involve building more complex n8n workflows, fine-tuning models with NeMo, and accelerating data pipelines with RAPIDS.
